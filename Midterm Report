We have employed a "trial and error" approach to our selection of datasets. While we started out with a focus on fMRI data, we quickly found that fMRI/MRI 
datasets are hard to come by. Most datasets do not deal directly with major depressive disorder (MDD), and the ones that do are unusable for a variety of 
reasons, ranging from lack of data to a lack of normalization between brain scans/brain regions. Additionlly, we found it exceedingly difficult
and out of scope to attempt to write a machine learning algorithm that utilizes computer vision to analyze brain scans.
After we had this revelation, we decided to shift our focus to numeral MRI datasets. With this dataset, we ran into a different set of issues. Namely, 
normalization appeared to be an issue again - comparing MRI data from different studies and different brain regions would run the risk of faulty or 
inconclusive results, due to inconsistent metrics of data collection, ranging from MRI machine tonnage to individual differences in brain structure. 

We finally ended up looking at an EEG dataset. EEG data is usually easier to work with than MRI data, as EEG data is less visual and more numerical. 
Additionally, the brain waves recorded from EEG
