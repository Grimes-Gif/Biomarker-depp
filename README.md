# Biomarker-search
Machine learning project for CS4641 at Georgia Institute of Technology

Collab: Saif Syed Ali, Ibraheem Abutair, Matthew Johnson, Micah Grimes

The objective of this project is to use machine learning to gain insight on physical biomarkers present in the brain of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Our inclusion criteria is as follows: subject must have been diagnosed with MDD by a medical professional and must be having a current episode of major depression OR has had an episode of major depression in the past 6 months. 
The current research in this field is plentiful, but very few have used machine learning on imaging data in order to generate patterns. We believe that machine learning is especially useful in this field because it allows for the standardization, comparison, and subsequent analysis of datasets that come from different metrics/studies. Succesful completion of this project would allow us to provide physicians and researchers with possible predictive measures for the development of MDD. This would allow physicians to mark certain individuals as "high-risk" for MDD and can provide preventative care to the patient.


The dataset type used will be numerical data taken from the Archives of General Psychiatry. The nature of the sets is processed MRI data from individuals with MDD. The entire data sheet contains MRI results from 225 studies, which will be more than enough to run machine learning algorithms on. Each table from the dataset has 17 features. The targets will be discrete, as we hope to use these targets to determine specific biomarkers of MDD.
